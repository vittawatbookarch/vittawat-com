project1: With the modern urban living style, the rise of the skyscraper and condominium has been obstructed the air ventilation in the city. This problem has promoted the use of an air conditioner which is an additional pain-cost to people who are living in the urban area. Moreover, the waste of energy is another concern, which I believe that we should have a better way to confront and solve this issue. Generally, low-temperature wind has lower mass than the higher temperature wind, which cause the warm air rises up. The reason why poor ventilation room has higher temperature because warm air accumulate and stuck above the ceiling, without ventilated in the space. So this solution take an advantage of this principle to inhale a low-temperature wind from below, and exhale with a higher position to push a high-temperature wind out of space. To create thermal comfort, this design can automatically and precisely adjust the wind speed appropriately for the room temperature by using a thermal sensor. Beside, not only it is eco  but also provide a natural feeling.

fabricate: This Chandelier inspired by a fluid shape of fabric flowing with the wind, which designed for low ceiling or horizontal space. A fabrication of glass can be infinitely connect according to space.
fabricate2: Inspired from an architecture motive, to create connection between space and object.

wave: A permanent lighting installation. Designed for a hotel and residential named “Shama Lakeview Asoke.” The design intends to reflect a smooth movement and continuity of water wave to welcome a customer to flow inside the space. Each perspective will give a sense of different movement following the point of view. This chandelier has been design to fit in 28sqm. and 3.5 height with sprinkler spreading area confliction avoidance, in an emergency situation this chandelier allowed the sprinkler to work with full efficiency.
wave2: Inspired from a natural but geometric shape which enhance a similarity when seen in different angle
wave3: Rhythm of wave harmoniously move accoding to sprinkler projecting radius between space which be able to safe construsction and engineering cost. 

dp1: A gigantic 120sqm. outdoor chandelier, compile of 1400 individual lights and Italian blown glasses with different shading for Pavilion hotel in Malaysia. This chandelier has been installed at the drop-off of the hotel. The design acting as a lighting and a signage. At the center of the chandelier, the blown glasses were designed dynamically lower than the outer to communicate the designated spot to stop the car.
dp2: Gem stone represent rich and tough at the same time, this component suitable for using semi outdoor for a durability look but still luxury

chair: Invisible is the keyword of the design to make people who is sitting feel like they are sitting on the invisible running water. By the experiment of material process which is plastic extrusion by using PE plastic polyethalene to adjust the temperature which cause the crystal line and air bubbles inside. 

hana: The concept started from the “Increase an efficiency in Bangchaocha village by using product design strategy” Which this village is advanced about Bamboo weaving for over the past 50 years, the majority of the customers are mostly middle-aged Japanese women.The main product is the women purse which its shape is familiar normal shape, so that it has the limitation in selling products because there is no development about new weaving technique. Thus the idea was created to develop people by introducing them new techniques for difficult shape, mold making and design that used two layers of weaving which is rarely seen in Thailand. 

boodwood: The aim of this project is to figuring out the way to instilled value into a souvenir so that a simple act of giving and receiving gift can be ever more meaningful. To many people, it is not far-fetch to say that, non-life products fail to hold their value and, at some point in time, are often left unattended. This leads to the quest in trying to make our products express themselves and create a deeper emotional tie to the product’s owner expression onto our mini tree pots, ones can bring their seemingly lifeless plants to life. And this is the story of a living tress with a funny hairstyle that can express their emotion, waiting for human to nature them with gentle and care.
